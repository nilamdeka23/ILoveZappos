# ILoveZappos
Zappos Coding Challenge

###What does my design do?
1. Accept a search query from the user.
2. Makes a request to the Zappos API with the search input from the user.
3. Parses the response and displays the first product in a CardView
4. The "Add to Cart", floating action button animates to inform the user a product is added.

##Implementation Details
####To maintain a good quality of code, I decided to use the upcoming MVVM architectural pattern 
####I created three main packages: Model, View and ViewModel.

##Screenshots/UI


####I tried to follow the Material Design pattern in available time.

##Major Libraries used
* **RxJava + RxAndroid**: A way to work asynchronously and maintain the application scalable.
* **Retrofit** : For consuming Rest API.
* **Picasso**: For image loading.
